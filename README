The acutal readme is in readme.md -- so it renders on github...

This is my brainfart of a plan for this...

* Editing source inline
 -- curently when you edit a method, you find the node, and click on the property (relating to the element)
 -- it would be better edit in the 'full code preview' mode -- so you can see all the context.
 -- most of the work to make this happen has been done.
 * after keyup change
   * save the content. in the node.
   * recalculate the tree (with locations etc.) but do not rende
 * split the 'editing view' so it's more dynamic? rather than another tab -- eg. zoom out the image preview box right
 * make the text view a bit like a mini-nav area (but when you click it zooms in...)

Plain File editing..
 * recently opened files?
 * tree?
 * (
 
 
Known issues:
- I'm building....
  ** when you edit it's compiling in the background.. so the 'errors' may be out of date..
  ** it would be usefull to know this... in the UI..
